Game of Life
============

This is a simple pass at the ever-popular Game of Life. 

@jbrains and @jonkernpa did a ~45-minute remote pairing session in solidarity with the crowd at the Boulder, CO, code retreat (being shepherded by @coreyhaines and @chadfowler).

We used iChat so that both of us could drive. We were both on good pipes (20MB/s).

Always frustrating that the damn timer goes off too fast!
